# student_performance_data
  This repository contains an analysis of student performance data using various machine learning evaluation techniques.
## Project Overview
  The objective of this project is to test the understanding of various model evaluation techniques used in machine learning, including accuracy metrics, confusion matrix interpretation, ROC/AUC, and cross-validation.
## Dataset
  The dataset contains information about students, including their demographic details, study habits, and performance.
## Model Evaluation
  ### 1. Accuracy Metrics Calculation
  - **Accuracy:** 0.9164
  - **Precision:** 0.9153
  - **Recall:** 0.9164
  - **F1-Score:** 0.9132
These metrics indicate that the model performs well, with a high level of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
  ### 2. Confusion Matrix Interpretation
  - **Confusion Matrix:**
    [[ 17 4 4 3 5]
    [ 2 68 3 2 5]
    [ 0 3 108 5 5]
    [ 0 2 4 113 8]
    [ 0 2 0 3 352]]

The confusion matrix provides a detailed breakdown of the model's performance, showing the true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives for each class.
### 3. ROC/AUC Calculation
- **AUC Value:** 0.9469
  The ROC curve and AUC value indicate that the model has a high ability to distinguish between classes, with a 94.69% probability that the model will rank a randomly chosen positive instance higher than a randomly chosen negative one.
### 4. Cross-Validation Reporting
  **Mean Cross-Validation Accuracy:** 0.9193
  --**Standard Deviation of Cross-Validation Accuracy:** 0.1191
      Cross-validation ensures the robustness and generalizability of the model by providing a more reliable evaluation of its performance.
## Conclusion
  The model evaluation metrics and techniques used in this project demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of assessing a classification model's performance. The results show that the model is both accurate and reliable.
